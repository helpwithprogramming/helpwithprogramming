Your program will play a game with the user. The user choose 1 of 2 games: Name the Country, or Name the Capital City. Given a city, the user tries to name the country or given a country the user tries to name the city. You will keep score.
First you begin: decide how many times (10, 15, whatever) a question will be asked. Decide how many attempts the user will have to enter the correct answer. (2, 3 etc) Decide how you will score the answer. 10 points if correct or something similar…many 10 points if correct the first time, 5 on the second try….
Now this is the general logic of the game/ you should fill in the details
Let the user choose which game to play.
Read the file into two string arrays or 1 2-D string array* (keep track of how many are read, you will need this later
Prepare to keep score
Loop 1 depends on the number of questions that will be asked
Print the question “what is the capital of XXXXXX ?” (or XXXXXX is the capital of what country?) Note you need a random number to do this. The range is 0-number of elements in array.
Loop 2 depends on the number of attempts the user has to answer each query AND whether or not the answer is correct
Read the answer**
See if the answer is correct
If yes, print “the answer is correct” and add to score
If no, print that the answer is wrong
End loop 2
If user got answer wrong print the correct answer
Print the score
•	Since the data has _ in some city names you will have to replace these with blank characters or insert _ characters in the user’s input
**this must be read with getline……to accommodate blank spaces between words. You will either have to insert the _ to match the Input data or remove _ from the input data.
