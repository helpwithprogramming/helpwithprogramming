Based on the following data set, which are values from 0 - 100, write a program that will count the repetitions of data in the following data range:

1) 0 - 20

2) 21 - 40

3) 41 - 60

4) 61 - 80

5) 81 - 100

The data set is, points[20]={54,90,32,49,65,73,87,78,62,45,82,54,67,73,43,56,43,84,61,42}

Display the numbers on screen.

Display the frequencies on screen.

Create a second array sorted[20]. Duplicate the first array points[20] into sorted[20]. Implement a sorting algorithm to re-arrange the data values from the largest to the smallest.

Display the result on screen.
