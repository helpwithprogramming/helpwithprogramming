Write a program reverse.c that prompts the user for a nonnegative integer and outputs a
sequence consisting of the entered integer, as many 's as the number of digits of the entered
integer, and the entered integer with its digits reversed. Here is a sample run:
(~)$ a.out
Enter an integer: 0
0*0
(~)$ a.out
Enter an integer: 123
123***321
(~)$ a.out
Enter an integer: 12000
12000*****00021
(~)$ a.out
Enter an integer: 021
21**12
(~)$ a.out
Enter an integer: 3024
3024***
