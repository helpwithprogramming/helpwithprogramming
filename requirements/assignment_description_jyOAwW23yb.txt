Program reads from an external file, named data2.dat. The file has two columns. The first column is integers and the second is floating point. You are write the program so it prints two columns of numbers. The numbers in the columns are composed of the numbers in the second column of data2.dat. If a 0 is in column 1 of data2.dat, the corresponding number from column 2 is to go into the new column 1. If a 1 is in column 1 of data2.dat, the corresponding number from column 2 is to go into column 2 of the output. Note that the number corresponding to the first 0 is to be the first output and the number corresponding with the first 1 is to be the second output on the same line as the first number. The total number of lines is the largest of the total numbers of either 1's or 0's in column 1 of data2.dat. Note that if there are an unequal number of 1's or 0's then you should fill with 0.0's for the column with the s! maller number of entries. Print both columns with a %5.1f format.
