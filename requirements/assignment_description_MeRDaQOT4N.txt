Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10, then asks a player to guess your number. The player should be given three tries to guess your number.

Each time the player guesses, you should give them some feed back. Let them know if their guess was too high, or too low, or if they won the game!

When the player guess correctly the game is over, don't keep asking them to guess. And remember,after three wrong guesses, the computer wins!

DO NOT USE LOOPS for this program
