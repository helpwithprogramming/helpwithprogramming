1) When two points in time are compared, each given as hours(in military time, ranging from 0 and 23) and minutes, the following pseudocode determine which comes first.

If hour1 < hour 2
time1 comes first.
Else if hour1 and hour 2 are the same
if minute1 < minute2
time1 comes first.
Else if minute1 and minute2 are the same
time1 and time2 are the same
Else
time2 comes first
Else
time2 comes first.

Write a program that prompts the user for two points in time and prints the time that comes first then the other time.


2)The following algorithm yields the season(Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter) for a given month and day:

If month is 1, 2, 3, season = "Winter"
Else if Month is 4,5 or 6, season = "Spring"
Else if month is 7, 8, 9, season = "Summer"
Else if month is 10, 11, or 12, season = "Fall"
If month is divisible by 3 and day >= 21
If season "Winter", season = "Spring"
Else if season is "Spring", season = "Summer"
Else if season is "Summer", season = "Fall"
Else season = "Winter"

Write a program that prompts the user for a month and day and then prints the season, as determined by this algorithm.


3)The original U.S. income tax code of 1913 was very simple. There was no separate schedule for single or married tax payers.
The tax rate was:
1% on the first $50,000
2% on the amount over $50,000 up to $75,000
3% on the amount over $75,000 up to $100,000
4% on the amount over $100,000 up to $250,000
5% on the amount over $250,000 up to $500,000
6% on the amount over $500,000
Write a program that computes the income tax according to this schedule.
