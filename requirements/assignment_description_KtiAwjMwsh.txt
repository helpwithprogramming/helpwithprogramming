Project Description:	4.	Consider a checkout line at the grocery store. During any given second, the probability that a new customer joins the line is 0.02 (no more than one customer joins the line during any given second). The checkout clerk takes a random amount of time between 20 seconds to 75 seconds to serve each customer. Write a program to simulate this scenario for about one million seconds and print out the average number of seconds that a customer spends waiting in line before the clerk begins to serve the customer. Note that since you do not know the maximum number of customers that may be in line at any given time, you should use an ArrayList and not an array.
