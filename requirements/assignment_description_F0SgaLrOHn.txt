write a C program that will read a sequence of integer numbers,
one per line, from the file integers.dat. Upon reading all the numbers from the file, the
program will tell you (i.e., write on the screen) how many numbers you have entered,
how many among them were even, and how many were odd. The program must also
display the average of integer numbers that were odd.
