Write a program that simulates a simple payroll system. In this program, create classes to represent a Person, which can either be an Employee or a Manager. Managers are similar to employees but they also contain an ArrayList of Employee objects whom they manage. Managers make between $80000 and $120000 while employees make between $60000 and $90000 (you can generate these randomly â€“ see java.util.Random to try this). The main function should iterate through all employees and print their name, ID number, monthly salary (salary / 12), and check number (which should start at 100 and increment for each employee printed).
