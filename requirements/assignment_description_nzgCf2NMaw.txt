Project #3

A:	DEFINITION:

Prime:	A positive integer such as 5, 7, and 11 that could only be divided by 1 and itself;


B:	ASSIGNMENT:

Step 1.	You are going to write a program according to the following:

(a)	The user is going to enter one integer, say x.

(b)	The program will print out all the factors of x or “Prime”.

Step 2.	Refine step 1 so that your program will keep asking for an integer and print out the factors or print out “Prime”. The program will stop when user enters 0.

Step 3.	Refine step 2 so that your program will ask for two integers and print all the factors or the message “Prime” for each integer between x and y.

Step 4.	Refine step 3 so that your program will continue asking for two integers and print all the factors or the message “Prime” for each integer between x and y. The program will stop when the first integer is > the second.

Step 5.	Refine step 4 so that your program keeps the frequency count of the prime number and the average value of all the prime numbers found.

Example:	
Please enter two integers: 9 13
9:	3
10:	2	5
11:	Prime
12:	2	3	4	6
13:	Prime
There are 2 prime numbers. 
The average value of the prime numbers is 12.00 
Please enter two integers:
