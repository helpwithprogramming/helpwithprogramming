you are required to write a very simple star database program based on two datasets: the first one is a star dataset and the second one is a constellation dataset. The given star dataset contains around 4800 stars, and it is actually a very small subset of the Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogue by the European Space Agency. 

This assignment contains four tasks:
1. Implement the class Star for individual star
2. Implement the class Constellation for individual constellation
3. Implement the star database class StarDB; it uses classes Star and Constellation
4. Implement the main application class MainApp
