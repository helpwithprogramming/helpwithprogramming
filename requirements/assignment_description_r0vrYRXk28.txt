The Game of Craps 
player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw , the player wins. If the sum is 2,3,or 12 on the first throw (called "craps" ) the player loses and the house wins. If the sum is 4,5,6,8,9, or 10 on the first throw, then that sum becomes the player's point. To win, he must continue rolling the dice until he "makes his point", i.e. rolls the same sum again. If the player rolls 7 before making the point, he loses.
Create this game in C++:
write a function int rollDie( void) to simulate the rolling of 2 dice.
function should return a random number between 1 and 6
write a function int firstRoll ( void) to simulate the first roll.
Function should call rollDie two times.
It should then return 0 for a winning roll
It should return -1 for a losing roll
It should return the total roll value for non-winning non-losing rolls
write a function int makePoint ( int point) to simulate the later rolls.
Function should get as input the "point" to be made
It should then return -1 for a losing roll
It should return 0 for non-winning non-losing rolls
It should return 1 for a winning roll
