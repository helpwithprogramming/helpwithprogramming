Project Description:	You are going to create a program that will run a game called Lucky Aces.
The program should:
1. Ask the user for how much money they would like to put into the game.
2. Ask the user if they want to play or cash out.
3. If they play, deduct the cost of the game ($2) and play. If they cash out, tell them how
much they have.
4. After each round of the game, print the results, their winnings and their new balance to
the screen and ask them if they want to play again or cash out. (Go back to #3).
5. Use the random number generator method to randomly generate a card, a roll of a die
and a toss of a coin. The users winnings will be based on the following outcome:
Hint: The numbers can represent certain outcomes, but you will need to interpret
their values in the context of the game. Create methods called drawCard, rollDie
and tossCoin that will deal with the code for these actions.
Winnings Card Die Coin
$2 Red 1 or 2 Heads
$4 Spades 3 or 4 Tails
$6 Ace 5 or 6 Heads
$0 Any Other Combination of Card/Die/Coin

The results of each round played should be printed to a text file called
“gameResults.txt”. Each round should be on a separate line under the headings
Card, Die, Coin, and Balance. Try your best to get it to print in columns. Card
values should be entered in the file as a string with their face value as the first
character(s) and the suit as the second (i.e. 10H, JD, AC, 9S). Coin results should
be printed to the file as H and T or Heads and Tails.
