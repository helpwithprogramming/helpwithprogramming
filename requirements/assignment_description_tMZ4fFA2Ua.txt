Project Description:

The following algorithm yields the season(Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter) for a given month and day:

If month is 1, 2, 3, season = "Winter"
Else if Month is 4,5 or 6, season = "Spring"
Else if month is 7, 8, 9, season = "Summer"
Else if month is 10, 11, or 12, season = "Fall"
If month is divisible by 3 and day >= 21
If season "Winter", season = "Spring"
Else if season is "Spring", season = "Summer"
Else if season is "Summer", season = "Fall"
Else season = "Winter"

Write a program that prompts the user for a month and day and then prints the season, as determined by this algorithm.
