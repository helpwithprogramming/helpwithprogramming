Algorithm Review (30 pts)
1. (15 pts) Write an algorithm that takes as input a student’s grade (on a scale from 0 to 100)
and prints a message that tells the student what their grade is (≥90%: A, ≥80%: B, ≥70%:
C, ≥60%: B, otherwise F). For example, if the grade is a 93%, the algorithm would print:
You currently have an A (93%).
2. (15 pts) Write an algorithm that prints all of the numbers in a list that could be a student's
unweighted GPA (i.e., are between the values of 0.0 and 4.0). The algorithm should simply
ignore any numbers in the list that are outside of this range (i.e., you need to make sure
incorrect values are not printed).
